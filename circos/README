EXAMPLE

This is an example that demonstrates many features of Circos, some
advanced such as track automation. This example is not meant to be
used as a study tool, but rather to verify that your installation is
working.

To create the image, execute the 'run' script (UNIX)

> ./run

The image takes 50 second to generate on a 3.33GHz GHz Intel Xeon
X5680 machine. Most of it spent arranging labels in the gene name text
track. See run.out for what to expect.

For Windows users, please see

to learn how to run Circos.
